# Highlights:
- This is a Hangman game in Python that utilizes while and for loops as well as if-else statements. The objective of the game is for the user to guess a randomly selected word from a list of words. The user is given a limited number of attempts to guess the word, and with each incorrect guess, a hangman figure is displayed. If the user exhausts all attempts, they lose the game and the hangman figure is completely displayed.
- A random word is then selected from the list, and the number of attempts is set to 7. A countdown timer for 30 seconds is also initiated. The user is prompted to input a letter to guess the word. The program checks if the letter is present in the random word. If it is, the program displays "Nice Job! You got it!" and prints the correctly guessed letters of the word. If the letter is not present in the word, the program displays "Awch! You got it wrong. There are no [guess] in the random word. [failure_count] turn(s) left." and the corresponding hangman figure.
